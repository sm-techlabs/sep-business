# Minimal SEP App Scaffold

A minimal web application scaffold demonstrating a basic request/response cycle between a static HTML frontend and a Node.js Express backend.

## Running Locally

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend will run at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend

1. Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click the "Fetch Hello" button to see the response from the backend.
